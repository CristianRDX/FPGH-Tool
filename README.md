# ABOUT THIS TOOL

This small application allows you to perform common actions on DVDFab music/streaming downloaders and video convertion applications. It also allows the extraction of download links of offline installers, from an online installer. These two features are described separately below.

# APPLICATION MANAGEMENT

Available actions are:

- Run application: Starts the selected application.

- Uninstall application: Shortcut to run the uninstaller for the selected application.

- Open Install Folder: A quick way to open the folder where the selected application is located.

- Clear Cache/Temp Folder: Allows you to delete the contents of the temporary folder used by
  applications to store, among other things, the browsing cache of the sites/services used. Use this
  option when you have problems logging in or other type of download error, with some service.  
  IMPORTANT: Please note that this action will log you out of all the services you are logged into.

- Clear Log Folder: As the name suggests, it allows you to delete the contents of the folder where
  the program logs are stored. Use this option to delete logs when they are very extensive/outdated.

- Open Log File: Open the log file of the selected app in Notepad. Use this option to troubleshoot
  errors.

- Open Output Folder: Just a quick shortcut to open the output folder of the application. Usually
  downloaded/converted videos/music goes here.

- Clear Authorization Credentials: Allows you to clear the credentials currently used by
  applications to authenticate to DVDFab services. Use this option if you want to reauthorize the
  application with new credentials.

- Set Authorization Credentials: Allows you to set the credentials used by applications to
  authenticate with DVDFab services. With this option you can set username (email) and password
  quickly, without having to delete the credentials and then re-authenticate from the application.
  Once you select this option, you will need to specify the credentials and the tool will replace
  the credentials currently used in the application with the ones you specified. Use this option to
  quickly switch accounts.

- Create Free Account: Open the link to the registration website to create a free account for the
  selected app.

- Create Temp Email Account: Opens a link to a website to create a temporary email account. If you
  don't want to use the suggested site, you can click the down arrow to display a full list of other
  sites for creating temporary email accounts.

# OFFLINE INSTALLER LINK EXTRACTOR

To use this tool, just enter the name and full path to the online installer you downloaded from one of the DVDFab applications' websites or click the "..." button to browse and select the installer EXE file.

Once you specify the online installer file, click "EXTRACT" to extract the links to the offline installers for the application. The list in the middle will show these links, grouped by 32-bit and 64-bit installers.

NOTE: Some applications are only available for x64. In that case the 64-bit links are repeated in the 32-bit group.

Once the links have been extracted, use the buttons at the bottom or the context menu to select the desired links and copy them to the clipboard. You can also manually place a check mark on certain links you want.
